### Macros for Office Applications

Here are some macros that may be useful when working with Office applications.  

[BorderTotals.vb](BorderTotals.vb)  
Useful for adding a border to a "row" that is a total (defined as starting with the cell containing "Total" continuing to the last non empty cell.)

[HideZeroRows.vb](HideZeroRows.vb)  
Useful for hiding rows that contain numbers which are all zero. 
Only numbers will be checked and the row will be hidden if all numbers are zero regardless of other text.
